I'm Hayden Carpenter. I'm an undergraduate student at The Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia.
I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a focus on AI and Media and minor in Psychology.

I'm also a Senior Developer at [Bits Of Good](https://bitsofgood.org), a Hack4Impact Chapter at Georgia Tech, where I work on app development for nonprofits. One other cool thing I do is help run Fantasy Stork Club where we bet on stork migration like you would Fantasy Football.
