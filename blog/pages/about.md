Hi, I'm Hayden Carpenter, an undergraduate student at The Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia.
I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a focus on [Systems & Architecture](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/threads/systems-architecture) and [Cybersecurity & Privacy](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/cybersecurity-and-privacy). I also have a minor in Psychology.

Out of class, I'm the Director of Engineering for [Bits Of Good](https://bitsofgood.org), a Hack4Impact Chapter at Georgia Tech, where I work on app development for non-profits.

Feel free to reach out!
