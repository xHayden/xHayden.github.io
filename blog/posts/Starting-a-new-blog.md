title: Starting a New Blog
description: >-
  There are so many ways to spend your time. You could play sports, sleep, go
  outside, touch grass, have a social life, etc. Unfortunately, none of those
  things are things that Computer Science majors do. So, to be a true CS major,
  I decided to start a blog.

I don't like writing. It's boring, it's slow, and it generally takes time away from actually solving problems. That's why this site is so marvelously speckled with features and optimizations-because I don't want to actually write.

I think my feelings towards writing make my writing better. If I'm writing, there's purpose behind it. For example, I'm writing this post to test the functionality of the blog site I just spent the last 20+ hours making and the [CMS system](https://tina.io/ "CMS System") I have attached to it.

Here are the reasons for most of the writing I'll be doing (100% just to test the styling on my lists).

* Get myself more motivated to work on projects.
* Keep track of the research I do and the random things I play around with only to abandon.
* Stand out on job applications.
* Help people learn things that I spent too much time learning.

While this site and all of its content will be useless in the future other than to help train AI models, I hope it serves that function well.

Just a few final tests before I end this.

### Final Tests

1. Wow
2. This
3. Is
4. A
5. List

Could you *believe* that!?!? So neat.

Making a difference, one `git commit` at a time.
