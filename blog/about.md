{% headers "About", ""%}

I'm Hayden Carpenter. I'm an undergraduate student at The Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia.
I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a focus on AI and Media.

I'm also a Senior Developer at [Bits Of Good](https://bitsofgood.org), a Hack4Impact Chapter at Georgia Tech, where I work on app development for nonprofits. I also help run Fantasy Stork Club where we bet on stork migration like amateurs would Fantasy Football. It's a lot of fun!

Feel free to reach out!
